      <h2 class="text"> Here is a timeline of Dr. Drew's Life </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong> 1904 </strong> - Born in Washington DC </li>
        <li> <strong> 1926 </strong> - Graduates Amherst College Massachusetts after earning an atheltic scholarship</li>
        <li> <strong> 1926 </strong> - Gains employment as a professor of Chemistry & Bilogy at Morgan College, Baltimore for 2 years. Earning money to pay for Medical school.  </li>
              <li> <strong> 1928 </strong> - Accepted into McGill University Montreal, Quebec </li>
        <li> <strong> 1933 </strong> - Graduates second in his academic class receiving Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery degrees.</li>
        <li> <strong> 1935 </strong> - Appointed faculty instructor of Pathology at Howard University. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1936 </strong> - Joins Freedman's Hospital as surgery instructor & assitant surgeon. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1938 </strong> - Drew began graduate work at Columbia University’s Presbyterian Hospital in New York under a two-year Rockefeller Foundation Research Fellowship in surgery. Drew’s work focused on trying to solve one of the most challenging medical problems of the time: how to “bank” or store blood so it would be available for transfusions long after it was donated. Drew’s doctoral thesis, “Banked Blood: A Study in Blood Preservation,” an exhausitve study in the field and shared his experimental research findings at the hospital, that blood was able to be preserved for longer when the cells are removed from the plasma, which can then be added back when needed. He outlined best practices for how to collect blood with sterile equipment, transfer it into sterile containers, treat it with anticoagulant, store it at a constant temperature in refrigerators that were reliably efficient, and transport it</li>
        <li> <strong> 1940 </strong> - Becomes first African-American to earn Doctor of Science in Medicine Degree from Columbia University due to his scientific breakthorughs in his thesis paper. Drew worked with John Scudder and E. H. L. Corwin to draw up a blueprint for Blood for Britain. Their blood bank at Presbyterian Hospital served as an organizational template, but had to be scaled up enormously to collect, process, and store large amounts of plasma at six (later nine) different hospitals. Besides the basic blood bank operation, they had to set up procedures for extracting plasma and ensuring that it would still be uncontaminated and safe to use when it arrived in Britain. Plasma was separated from the blood cells by centrifuging or sedimentation, then the plasma from an average of eight collection bottles was pooled (using an aseptic procedure in a dust-proof, air-conditioned, ultraviolet-lighted room, under a lab hood), and a sample cultured for bacteria; Merthiolate (an anti-bacterial) was added, and the batch tested again after a week. Finally, each batch was transferred to a shipping container (again using aseptic methods) and diluted with sterile saline solution. A final sample for bacteria testing was taken before the containers were sealed and packed. Despite its size and complexity, the project was set up quickly, and a trial shipment of plasma was sent to England in early August. The British reported that it was ‘entirely satisfactory’ and the program opened officially on August 16 1940.”
  In the end the program delivered over 5,000 litres of plasma to Britain by January 1941.

        <li> <strong> 1946 </strong> - Elected to the International College of Surgeons after being racistly rejected for appointed to the American Medical Association. </li>
        <li> <strong> 1950 </strong> - Dr. Drew dies in an unfortunate car accident on the way to Tuskagee Alabama to attend a teaching hospital clinic he attended since 1939.</li> 
        <li> <strong> 2015 </strong> - Posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In addition to his blood research, Drew also was issued patents as co-inventor with Philip P. Goland for a surgical needle (US Patent 2,389,355) and a surgical suction apparatus (US Patent 2,397,257). </li>
